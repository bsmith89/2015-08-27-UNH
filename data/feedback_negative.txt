# Session 1 -- Shell

Beginning was very slow
Just the visualizing of the current directory on the big screen [referring to not knowing what dir the instructor was in at all times]
Maybe a handout with unix terms: rm, cp ...
Frustrating that some things don't work on windows
have us give you nods if we are following
Maybe just check in if people are following
It may (or may not) be useful to have larger scripts that we just look at and/or modify
Very slow progression
Diversity in knowledge forces the workshop to go slower but it's necessary
Wish we could go over bash profile issues
maybe another exercise or two on our own or with neighbors
started a bit slow, and really looking forward to python
started a bit slow
[just a dash]
It may be helpful to leave the script up while we're looking at the website on the screen
could go a little faster


# Session 2 -- Python I

It would be nice to go over a pre-written, more complicated code to discuss and/or modify it
Just so much to learn (nothing bad!)
Send out a copy of your notebook, pls.
The python portion went a little too fast and the screen usually wasn't showing the step I was on
Maybe send out a copy of the notebook
More explanation of actual files/folders/path associated with python
it would be nice mix some bash and python script. very useful workshop! thanks
tell group little command you use without noticing e.g. ^m-b (time permitting)
a bigger screen would be helpful to see more commands on the screen at once
too fast paced for me - a newbie!


# Session 3 -- Git

I work with proprietary data format: so I can't use open Github :(
didn't use git reset
difficult to follow, I think because git is not as intuitive as python
It would have been nice to see ways that Git relates to real projects. I had trouble seeing how it would be useful.
Very useful to share and edit documents. - Would be good to know how to do it with .m files
Just need more time and try more problems
Try not to use "alias" [referring to some git aliases Ivan had set up]
Now I want margaritas in the afternoon [referring to Ivan's guacamole recipe example]
It would be nice to: - Ask us to download only files that we need - if possible have the command prompt on one half of the screen or a separate screen at all times
It would be nice to get nano or something similar working on PCs


# Session 4 -- Python II

--
Just a lot of information
extend both days by 30 min to get more time for last session
Consider doing the project differently. Maybe you can have a pre-written code in Spyder? Too many commands presented without explanation of what exactly they do. I wish there was more on making "pretty" plots with axes, legends, error bars, etc.
The ultimate goal of the challenge questions could be explained better so know what we're trying to do
